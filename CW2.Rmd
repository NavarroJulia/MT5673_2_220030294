## Problem A 

<!--- Tasks:

Problem A
• Consider the following independent random variables:
– X ∼ N (µ = 4, σ2 = 10)
– Y ∼ U(a = 2, b = 8)
• Compute the probability that X > Y , i.e. Pr(X > Y ).
• Use bootstrapping to derive the sampling distribution for your estimate of Pr(X > Y ).
• Show how the sample variance of this sampling distribution changes as a function of the number of
Monte Carlo simulations.

``` {r, echo = FALSE}
num_sim = 10000

set.seed(314)

## create a vector of length num_sim of all zeros:
P <- rep(0, num_sim) 

for(i in 1:num_sim){

X <- rnorm(1, mean=4, sd=sqrt(10))
Y <- runif(1, min=2, max=8)

if(X>Y){
  
  P[i] <- 1
  
      }
}

print(sum(P)/num_sim)

## want something like:
## if prob X>Y 'do something'
##prob is just = nbr of successes (X>Y)/ number of attempts
## x[i] <- 1

```

## Problem B

<!--- 


Problem B
• Consider the following football tournament format: a team keeps playing until they accrue 7 wins or 3
losses (whichever comes first - no draws allowed). Assume a fixed win rate p ∈ [0, 1] across all rounds
(they are paired at random).
• Plot how the total number of matches played (i.e. wins + losses) varies as a function of p.
• Comment on the observed win rate relative to the assumed win rate p (i.e. if a team obtains 2 wins -
3 losses, the maximum likelihood point estimate for their win rate is 40%). Specifically, focus on the
effect driven by the format of this tournament.
