## Problem A 

<!--- Tasks:

Problem A
• Consider the following independent random variables:
– X ∼ N (µ = 4, σ2 = 10)
– Y ∼ U(a = 2, b = 8)
• Compute the probability that X > Y , i.e. Pr(X > Y ).
• Use bootstrapping to derive the sampling distribution for your estimate of Pr(X > Y ).
• Show how the sample variance of this sampling distribution changes as a function of the number of
Monte Carlo simulations.

## Problem B

<!--- 


Problem B
• Consider the following football tournament format: a team keeps playing until they accrue 7 wins or 3
losses (whichever comes first - no draws allowed). Assume a fixed win rate p ∈ [0, 1] across all rounds
(they are paired at random).
• Plot how the total number of matches played (i.e. wins + losses) varies as a function of p.
• Comment on the observed win rate relative to the assumed win rate p (i.e. if a team obtains 2 wins -
3 losses, the maximum likelihood point estimate for their win rate is 40%). Specifically, focus on the
effect driven by the format of this tournament.
